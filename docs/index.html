                        While this progress looks meager, it paves the road for a lot more content down the road.
                        I plan to make the StatefulSprite have not only more states, but toggles for them all using
                        export flags.
                        In a case like this, I can pick and choose what states I may want a certain character to have.
                        For example, bats can fly, but they definitely don't walk. Players can walk, but they definitely
                        can't fly.
                        They can both utilize the shared code of the StatefulSprite while still offering a great deal of
                        customization.

                    <p>
                        Some crucial things happened this week.
                        However, I am sorry to admit that, despite this,
                        not much time was spent developing the game this week.
                    </p>
                    <p>First and foremost, let's see what happened in this week's commits.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>SpriteStateMachine</code> was renamed/refactored to <code>StatefulSprite</code>.</li>
                        <li>Loads of content was added to this README.</li>
                        <li>Added a tool to procedurally generate a tile map based on a noise map.</li>
                        <li>
                            Revamped that tool to work with tile sources with "erased" tiles.
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>That is, tile sources that aren't a perfect rectangle of enabled squares.</i>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Created the <a href="https://kxttykxt.itch.io/fate-of-angora" target="_blank">itch.io
                                page</a> for the project. You likely cannot see this page at this time, though.</li>

                        I can make excuses all day for the sparse work done.

                                I was busy, I have multiple projects going on, I fell ill,
                                I had to do a lot of housework, I needed a break from many things.

                    <p>
                        But the bottom line is that I need to step up.
                        That is why, from this day forward, it will be my personal goal to make
                        <b><i>one commit every day</i>, good or bad, large or small.</b>

                        When I find myself dreading the mountain of work that this project entails,
                        it's important to remind myself that I actually have fun when I'm developing this.
                        Making at least one commit every day shall remind me that I enjoy it,
                        and hopefully I will then dread it far less.

                    <summary>Homewardbound to Soulbound</summary>
                    <p>
                        I have decided to scrap Fate of Angora. The development felt forced, and I was too rigid with
                        too new an idea. It felt like a chore. My heart just wasn't in it. The important part now is
                        that I have learned a whole lot of valuable material from my preliminary work on Fate of Angora.
                        Noise-based procedural tilemap generation alone feels like a feat in its own right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scrapping an entire project a couple weeks into the (pre?)-production cycle is not an action I
                        take lightly (even though I've done it once already). I assessed the time left to complete the
                        project and whether a switch to a more ambitious project was a good idea. Given the fact that
                        I've been brainstorming Soulbound off and on for literal years means I have a streamlined
                        structure for how to get there.
                    </p>
